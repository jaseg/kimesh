This repository contains KiMesh, a KiCAD pcbnew plugin that generates security mesh traces on a KiCAD PCB.

Installation
------------
To install, copy the "kimesh" directory into your KiCAD installation's scripting plugin folder. Usually, this is
`~/.config/kicad/scripting/plugins/` for KiCAD stable installations or `~/.config/kicad/5.99/scripting/plugins/` for
nightly builds. On Windows, these paths can be found in your user account's `AppData/Roaming` directory.

Theory of operation
-------------------

I have published a post_ on my blog on the theory of operation behind KiMesh.
